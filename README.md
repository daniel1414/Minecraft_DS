# Minecraft_DS
Classic Minecraft for the game console Nintendo DS implemented with help of the devkitPro Toolchain.

# Disclaimer
Not Minecraft, just pseudo-randomly generated terrain, some collision and block destruction.

  - World generation (used with own implementation of two dimensional Perlin Noise based on Dave Mount & Roger Eastman's CMSC 425 Lecture 13)
